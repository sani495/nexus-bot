# Bank & Credits

{% hint style="info" %}
Credit is an agreement between a lender and a borrower.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## What are credits?

In economics, credit is the ability to buy something now and pay for it later. It's a transaction between a lender and a borrower, where the lender provides money, goods, or services in exchange for a future payment.&#x20;

## How can I receive them?

Credits can be exchanged by using the command `bank`  and press "create a bank". In order to receive credits, you'll need to create a bank account and enter the credentials in the corresponding picture below.&#x20;

## Here's a list of how they work:

* A form of borrowing money&#x20;
* Can be used to buy things like cars, houses, and college expenses&#x20;
* Can be arranged directly between a buyer and seller, or through a financial institution like a bank

## How can they be used?

# FAQ

### Why do I keep getting these `AoiErrors`?

_AoiErrors_ often occur due to several reasons, including system configuration or software bugs. If encountered frequently, please document the error details and report them to the support team as soon as possible for further investigation and resolution.

### Why are roles not being assigned after a purchase?

Ensure that the bot's roles are positioned **above** the roles that are being purchased in your server's role hierarchy. This is crucial because bots can only manage roles that are lower than their highest role in the hierarchy. Adjusting the role order will allow the bot to assign the purchased roles successfully.

### What are credits and why are they important?

Credits are powerful currency values that allow you to do certain things. Whether it's changing the bot's prefix to using one to buy an item on your server market. You can receive them by using the command, setting up & activating your bank. See the next card for more information!

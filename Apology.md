## Dev's apology & explanation
Nexus, originally known as Pheonix, had to be taken down and moved to the new bot for several reasons. Some jerk (who probably never touched grass before) managed to hack and leak into sensitive information, tampering with it's api token and mixing up it's system creating unnecessary and impossible issues for both me and server members who were participating. 

_**It gave me a MASSIVE headache**_.  

For the safety of others, I had to delete the bot and migrate it's host to a new one, forcing it all the servers and their participated progress to fall greatly (but, not deleted). The decision was made to avoid harmful deities to future and current participants.

I apologize in advance to those who were having a great time with using Pheonix and those who weren't really interested as well. With this new bot, I am working to better it's appearance for everyone to enjoy. 

You can still use the bot here in my [support server](https://discord.gg/YBS5AygwYT)! 

## When will the bot become public again?
Next year. It's not decided when, but I guarantee you. Be on the lookout for some updates.

## Are you the only dev?
Yep! I am coding my own bots. I'm not looking for a developer team.

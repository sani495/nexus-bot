# BOT NEWS!!
*GREETINGS!! I come to bring great news! Stay around to read the providing information below.*

### What is going on?
Nexus will be public as promised **AFTER** this big update that I have been working on for 3 months now. It's going to be amazing and should be easy to use. As always, you may be able to report lil bugs to me (as a single developer).

**Remember: I am the only dev! There is no ETA when there is going to be an update or bug. I will respond to the best of my ability but is about it.**

ðŸ—’: **If you go back to [Main](https://github.com/sani495/nexus-bot/blob/main/developers-apology.md), I have hidden the name of the Nexus' old name. Can you find it?**
